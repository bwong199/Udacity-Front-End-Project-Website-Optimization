Process in optmizing the website: 

1) i went here and tested out the site I hosted on github - https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/

2) I replaced the existing files with the ones in the optimized-contents file, including the pizzeria.jpg, profilepic.jpg and the main.js

3) I moved minified the style.css file and put it in index.html, rather than having a link to a separate file 

4) I moved all the css and js linked files in pizza.html to the bottom of the page

5) In main.js, I replaced the for loop in changePizzaSizes function to a switch statement.


This is where I learned all that - https://www.udemy.com/running-websites-faster-with-basic-performance-tuning/learn/v4/t/lecture/2488828
